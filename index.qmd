About me:

I am an accounting major with a passion for numbers and precision, combined with a love for global experiences. Originally from Vietnam, I am fluent in Vietnamese, English and a learner of French language, allowing me to connect with diverse cultures and communities. Beyond academics, I enjoy playing soccer, a sport that fuels my teamwork and competitive spirit. My ultimate goal is to work in a dynamic, international environment that allows me to travel the world, embrace new challenges, and grow both personally and professionally.
